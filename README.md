# Algorithms course 

I want just to use Jest as a helper via an algorithms course. So I am creating this tiny project. 

## How to run the examples? 

Well ... I doubt anyone will ever want to run these examples, 
but if one appears can use this one liner.

```
git clone https://github.com/gonaumov/algorithms-course.git && cd algorithms-course && npm i && npm test 
```
